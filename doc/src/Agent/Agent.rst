:mod:`Agent.Agent`
=========================
The Agent runs a series of plugins, each responsible for either gathering or processing data and returning
it to the Agent.  The agent then passes the data to the Event Manager.  The Agent is also responsible to ensure
the proper operation of the plugins, and restart them as necessary.
